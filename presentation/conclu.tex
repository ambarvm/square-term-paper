  \begin{beamerboxesrounded}{Similarity with AES}
    SQUARE, which is a predecessor of AES is very similar to AES in it's structure and S-box. And shares some common attacks.

  \begin{beamerboxesrounded}{Attacks}
    Practical attacks for up to six rounds are known for SQUARE  and hence the number rounds is 8 following a conservative approach.

  \begin{beamerboxesrounded}{Use in real world}
    Even though the known full round attacks are not practical, the authors recommend against using it in applications due to lack of intense public scrutiny.
