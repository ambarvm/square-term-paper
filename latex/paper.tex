\section{Introduction}

Widely used primitives like the AES~\cite{AES} do not have perfect
security, and can be analysed with linear
cryptanalysis~\cite{EC:Matsui93}, differential
cryptanalysis~\cite{JC:BihSha91}, or differential power
analysis~\cite{C:KocJafJun99}.  We show that the One-Time-Pad is
unconditionally secure in \autoref{sec:main}.

\section{Properties}
\subsection{DDT}
The Difference Distribution Table (DDT) has the highest value 4. Therefore, the maximum probabilty of a characteristic for difference across a single substitution $\frac{4}{256}$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item For each non-zero input difference, the maximum value of 4 occurs exactly once, 2 occurs 126 times and 0 occurs 129 times.
  \item For each non-zero output difference, the maximum value of 4 occurs exactly once, 2 occurs 126 times and 0 occurs 129 times..
  \item There are 33,150 zeroes in the DDT. Hence, roughly half of the input/output difference pairs are impossible.
\end{itemize}

The S-Box for SQUARE is different from that of AES but similar as these three properties are also followed the AES S-Box.
